  "description": "Check pseudo-label quality with K=8 samples per prompt using base model",
  "question": "Does increasing K from 4 to 8 improve pseudo-label accuracy above 50%?",
  "config": {
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct",
    "K": 8,

  "comparison": {

    "improvement": 0.14
  },
  "interpretation": "K=8 improved accuracy from 38% to 52%, crossing our 50% threshold. High-confidence examples remain 100% accurate but are rarer (8 vs 13). The improvement confirms the model CAN be right more often with more samples, but it's borderline.",
  "decision": "PROCEED with V1 experiment using K=8",
  "next_step": "Run full V1: baseline vs noisy student vs oracle"
