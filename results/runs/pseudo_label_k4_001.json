  "description": "Check pseudo-label quality with K=4 samples per prompt using base model",
  "question": "Can the base model produce reliable consensus pseudo-labels?",
  "config": {
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct",
    "K": 4,
    "sample_size": 100,

    "high_confidence_accuracy": 1.0,
    "high_confidence_count": 13,
    "high_confidence_threshold": 0.75
  },
  "interpretation": "38% overall accuracy is below 50% target. However, high-confidence examples (>=75% agreement) are 100% accurate, just rare (13%). This suggests the model CAN be right when confident, but K=4 doesn't produce enough confident examples.",
  "next_step": "Try K=8 to see if more samples produce more high-confidence examples and better overall accuracy"
